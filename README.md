# Electronic Cash Demo

The ecash is an open source electronic cash library that allows developers to create ecash platform to facilitate the locating and transfer of ecash between benefactors and beneficiaries.

Go to the [electronic cash tutorials](http://ecash-tutorial.web.app) or download the [electronic cash module](https://github.com/VeinSyct/ECash-Module/tree/main/module-ecash/platform) to start making your electronic cash platform. 

Note: This repository is not capable of creating ecash, only the ecash virtual location is stored in the device so that no one is capable of tampering the ecash data.

What separates this electronic cash from cryptos and other digital payment, this app was developed for future purpose to handle massive wealth in preparation for off grid and off planet economies, the concept was cenceived from the idea of space economy as the existing digital currencies do not posses. This electronic cash is intended to solve the basic necessities of electronic economies.

For **web developers** and designers we welcome and invite you to collaborate with us creating electronic cash front end and back end features, for better user experiences, let us know if when you need to develop the optical transfer of demo ecash, we will provide demo ecash upon request.

1. Create your frond end (using Figma, Wordpress, Laravel or just plane HTML coding).
2. Interface the electronic cash using the example in the public folder.


For the **hackers** and other enthusiasts we invite you to find vulnerabilities, loop holes or bugs in this system to further improve and enhance the electronic cash data securities, please do share your found vulnerabilities loop holes and bugs, we would specifically ask you to tampered the electronic cash in demonstration by video or other means:

**Challenges:**
1. Make an instance of changing the dummy ecash amount (ex. make the DMY 1,...000.00 to 2,...000.00 or any amount).
2. Duplicate an account to any number of cloned accounts, spend one and then spend the next clones (to see if we can do a double spending instance).
3. Change the currency (example the currency is **DMY** change into **USD** or the currency of your choice).
4. Transfer an account ecash data (steal) to a newly created account.


The electronic cash repository implements a basic electronic cash system, this project allows ecash transfers and storage for users to conduct secure and anonymous transactions without relying on a central authority or server.

Here's a breakdown of how use the repository:

**Core Components**
Cash Creation and Minting:

The ecash does not create ecash, it has no capability to create ecash, instead it can split and transfer ecash to a beneficiary device.

**Security elements:**
The system relies on enthrophy chaos algorithm to store and ensure that e-cash secured and can only be transferred by the device it resides in.
The e-cash is designed to be anonymous and secured. transactions are signed with private keys to ensure authenticity and prevent double-spending.

**Transactions:**
The transactions are the core of the system. When one user wants to transfer e-cash to another, the transfer process involves verifying the authenticity of the funds being transferred and updating the balance of both users.

**Spending and Verification:**
Once e-cash is received, the holder can spend it. This involves splitting and transferring the ecash to another user or device that uses the same backend. The system verifies whether the ecash are valid and if the transaction can be executed without double-spending.

**Double Spending Prevention:**
To prevent the same digital cash from being spent multiple times (a problem called "double-spending"), the system typically keeps a record of spent e-cash and checks against this to ensure that a user doesnâ€™t spend the same ecash more than once.

**Offline Transactions:**
The system simulates offline transactions where users can transfer ecash without being online, using locally stored records (e.g., local databases or files). Once the system comes online, the transaction records are synchronized with the central ledger or server.

**ECash backend usage (iframe)**

```ruby
let iframe = document.createElement("iframe");
iframe.src = "https://ecash-icons.web.app";
document.body.appendChild(iframe);
iframe.onload = function() {
    // ecash is ready
};
```


**How to send message request to the ecash backend (iframe)**

1. Read ECash Balance - display your ecash balance

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55c266eb-55e7-4ffc-b189-08b50857437d)

```ruby
function readBalance() {
    iframe.contentWindow.postMessage({ action: "ecash-api-read-balance" }, iframe.src);
};
```


2. Read Account - display your ecash account number

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/944603f8-5770-4ca2-81b1-3cf4201a0ce0)

```ruby
function readAccount() {
    iframe.contentWindow.postMessage({ action: "ecash-api-read-account" }, iframe.src);
};
```


3. Show your accout QR code - for the benefactors to scan for transfering ecash to your account

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df15927a-9381-47e0-9846-b14b7ba33d17)

```ruby
window.hashAccount = function(d) {
    iframe.contentWindow.postMessage({ action: "ecash-api-hash-account" }, iframe.src);
};
```


4. Scan QR code - scan either account or ecash QR codes

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d2e3b43-f7c0-4a8b-8bf9-d53da7391f0b)

```ruby
window.scanQRCode = function(d) {
    iframe.contentWindow.postMessage({ action: "ecash-api-hash-assemble", qrScan: qrScan }, iframe.src);
};
```


5. Transfer ecash - first scan the beneficiary QR code and then set the amount, if the amount is valid the ecash QR code will display in rapid successing for fast transfer

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbbf2e83-5edf-45dd-9611-5b4cc3ac4e5f)

```ruby
iframe.contentWindow.postMessage({
        action: "ecash-api-transfer-amount",
        currency: document.querySelector(".beneficiary-currency").value,
        range: document.querySelector(".beneficiary-amount").value
    },
    iframe.api.src
);
```

How to receive message from the ecash (iframe) - after the ecash (iframe) processing the request it will return the result back to your app, you can receive the result by adding a event listerner as shown below: 

```ruby
window.addEventListener("message", () => {
    if (e.data.action && e.data.action.match(/(ecash-api)/)) {
        if (e.data.action && e.data.action.match(/(ready)/)) {
            readBalance();
            readAccount();
        };
        if (e.data.action && e.data.action.match(/(response)/)) {
            apiResponses({ data: e.data });
        };
    };
});
```

```ruby
function apiResponses(data) {
    data = data.data;
    if (data.action && data.action.match(/(read-balance)/)) {
        document.querySelector(".ex-balance").innerHTML = data.balance;
    };
    
    if (data.action && data.action.match(/(read-account)/)) {
        for (let i = 0, j = ["name", "number", "protocol"]; i < j.length; i++) 
            document.querySelector(".account-" + j[i]).innerHTML = data.account[j[i]] ? data.account[j[i]] : "***";
    };
    
    if (data.action && data.action.match(/(hash-account)/)) {
        createQr({
            s: data.hash 
        });
    };
    
    if (data.action && data.action.match(/(hash-fragment)/)) {
        for (let i = 0; i < data.hash.length; i++) drawQr({ id: ".qr-cont", piece: data.hash[i] });
        let cvs = { e: [], i: 0 };
        for (let i = 0, j = document.querySelector(".qr-cont").getElementsByTagName("canvas"); i < j.length; i++) {
            j[i].style.display = "none";
            j[i].style[window.innerWidth < window.innerHeight ? "width" : "height"] = "75%";
            cvs.e.push(j[i]);
        };
        if (cvs.e.length > 1) autoSlide({ t: delay });
        document.getElementById("show-qr-cont").style.display = "block";
    };
    
    if (data.action && data.action.match(/(hash-assemble)/)) {
        let d = JSON.parse(data.object);
        if (d.r) {
            if (d.r && d.ah) {
                document.querySelector(".beneficiary-name").innerHTML = d.ah.name;
                document.querySelector(".beneficiary-number").innerHTML = d.ah.number;
                document.querySelector(".beneficiary-currency").innerHTML = d.ah.currency;
            };
            
            if (d.l) {
                if (d.r && d.l.amount > 0) {
                    alert(`Electronic Cash ${d.l.currency}${d.l.amount}`);
                    readBalance();
                } else alert(`Electronic Cash is Spent`);
            }
        } else alert(`Wrong QR`);
    };
    
    if (data.action && data.action.match(/(transfer-amount)/)) {
        createQr({ s: data.hash });
    };
    
    if (data.action && data.action.match(/(dialog-message)/)) {
        if (data.message == "m001") alert("There is no benificiary");
    };

};
```

Scan the dummy ecash QR codes until a dialog appears "You have received a dummy ecash amount DMY 1,..0.00

During your app development make sure you set the "offline to flase" to disable your caching.

```ruby
let offline: !1; or let offline: false; 
```

or comment out the cache service lines;

```ruby
if (navigator.onLine && offline && "serviceWorker" in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker
        .register("index.js")
        .then((registration) => {})
        .catch((err) => {});
};
```

We look forward to see your ecahs apps and get it become a a working electronic cash platform.

Enjoy!
